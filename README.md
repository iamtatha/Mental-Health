# Mental-Health
Project of CS 725 course at IIT Bombay, Autumn 2022.

This project is completed as a part of the course Foundations of Machine Learning (CS 725) at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in Autumn, 2022. The course is offered by the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering of the institute. The project objective has been accomplished by a team of five M.Tech first year students.



# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to determine the mental state of an individual on the basis of its mental and physical wellbeing and its environment, and indicate whether professional help is required or not. For this project, we used various machine learning algorithms including Decision trees, Stacking, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Gradient Boost and Adaboost. The resulting outcomes are compared and used for selecting the appropriate model for the
predictions.
